Submit your record book here¬†and find helpful tips\, guides\, and resources for submitting your record book¬†here. \n				\n							\n					\n													\n															\n								\n														\n												If I don't attend the Summit\, how will I get my medal?\n					\n					Medals will be mailed to medalists who are unable to attend the Summit after the event takes place in June. We will attempt to set up local presentations for any medalists who who have indicated they would like one in their Record Book submission. \n				\n							\n					\n													\n															\n								\n														\n												Will travel costs or accommodations be covered?\n					\n					Travel costs and accommodations will not be covered by The Congressional Award.¬† \n				\n							\n					\n													\n															\n								\n														\n												Are we allowed to bring guests?\n					\n					Registration for the Gold Medal Summit is priced at $600 per medalist + processing fees. Each medalist has one (1) guest included in their registration. Medalists can add a second guest (Gold Medalist + 2 guests total) for a $200 additional guest fee.¬†This fee covers certain meals\, tickets\, venue costs\, and access to all Summit events. Please note that due to our large group and venue capacity\, we are NOT able to make exceptions to the guest allowance. Again\, unfortunately we do not have the capacity for additional guests\, including young children. \n				\n							\n					\n													\n															\n								\n														\n												Will meals be covered?\n					\n					Light refreshments will be provided throughout each day as well as a breakfast buffet\, lunch vouchers\, and meal voucher at the Nationals game for the Gold Medalist and their registered guests. \n				\n							\n					\n													\n															\n								\n														\n												Will scholarships/financial aid be available?\n					\n					We are excited to offer a registration fee waiver for the 2025 Gold Medal Summit to those who may need financial assistance. In the event registration form\, you will find an application form for a waived registration fee. Please note that this waiver will only cover the $600 registration fee for the medalist and 1 guest\, and does not include flights\, hotels\, or supplementary meals. A committee will review all requests for a waiver on a need-basis\, however\, please be aware that the number of slots available is limited. If your application is not approved\, you will be required to provide payment later on in order to attend the Summit. \n				\n							\n					\n													\n															\n								\n														\n												Am I guaranteed a meeting with my Member of Congress?\n					\n					Congressional meetings will take place throughout day 2 of the Summit (June 12\, 2025) in various locations within the Capitol complex. While we are unable to guarantee that your Representative and/or Senator(s) will be available due to the ongoing legislative and voting schedule\, we will begin the scheduling process for you ASAP and attempt to get your meeting(s) on the schedule. Please note that Congressional office staff will be scheduling meeting(s) directly with you and your fellow medalists\, so please keep an eye on your email and respond promptly when they reach out in a few weeks to coordinate a time and place. If you do not request a meeting on the event registration form\, we will not reach out to schedule a meeting on your behalf. In lieu of a Congressional meeting\, you will have the opportunity to attend all of the expert speaking panels throughout the day. Regardless\, there will be many opportunities to meet with legislative\, business and civic leaders throughout the Summit. We will work with you to arrange meeting opportunities in recognition of earning your Gold Medal. \n				\n							\n					\n													\n															\n								\n														\n												I have special needs/need handicap accessibility. Will this be taken into account at the event?\n					\n					Please be sure to indicate if you and/or your guest(s) need assistance coordinating accessibility accommodations when filling out the event registration form so we can provide the necessary information to our venues. We are more than happy to assist with your needs in order to ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience. Most of the events of the 2025 Gold Medal Summit will take place in The U.S. Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) as well as the Senate and House of Representative Office Buildings\, which all offer a variety of services for individuals with disabilities. Read more about the CVC accessibility services here\, and the House/Senate Office Buildings¬†here.¬†Supplementary events will take place at local hotels\, sporting event venues\, and local museums or event spaces. As these venues are secured\, we will be sure to prioritize sending out information on ADA compliance and accessibility services. Our team will be ready to assist any individuals with special needs. \n				\n							\n					\n													\n															\n								\n														\n												Will there be a formal Gold Medal Ceremony like in years past?\n					\n					Due to the increasing number of medalists\, in addition to restrictions in the Capitol\, the 2025 Gold Medal Summit will not include a formal ceremony. We have shifted to an in-person summit model for medalists to meet with their Members of Congress in an environment that encourages conversation and interaction. \n				\n							\n					\n													\n															\n								\n														\n												Will previous Gold Medal classes be able to attend?\n					\n					Unfortunately\, we will not be able to extend an invitation to medalists beyond the 2025 class at this time. However\, we would still like to offer you a few opportunities to stay involved as an alumni member of the program: We invite you to consider applying to become a Diversity Ambassador\, a role that provides opportunities to promote diversity\, equity\, and inclusion within the Congressional Award community.We encourage you to join our alumni network on LinkedIn\, where you can connect with fellow medalists and stay informed about upcoming events and career opportunities.We also encourage you to check out the resources in our Career Center\, where you can find valuable tools and guidance to help you pursue your career goals and find job opportunities from our corporate partners.\n				\n							\n					\n													\n															\n								\n														\n												What is the agenda?\n					\n					Please refer to the brief snapshot of the itinerary included at the beginning of this webpage. Attendees will be notified once the agenda is finalized in the coming weeks. \n				\n										\n					\n				\n				\n					\n		\n					\n		\n				\n		 \n\nWe look forward to celebrating your achievements as you continue Reaching New Heights at the 2025 Gold Medal Summit.
