                                <p>There is some dispute in Uganda on what 
                                  political force removed Amin's military 
                                  dictatorship.
                                  The Amin coup was effected and supported by 
                                  powerful countries abroad. The dictatorship 
                                  which the coup ushered was therefore a political
                                  force in which countries abroad had much interest
                                  and wanted the dictatorship to last. The 
                                  counter political forces in Uganda, composed of
                                  the leaders and members of the UPC and leaders 
                                  and members of the DP were not organised.
</p>
                                <p>When Amin appointed the DP leader and the leader
                                  accepted to be Chief Justice in a dictatorship, 
                                  the DP component of the unorganised counter political
                                  force became impotent, leaving only the UPC component.
                                  Had the UPC done, nothing, there would have been no 
                                  Uganda political force in the removal of Amin. This 
                                  Paper, gives in summary what the UPC did from January
                                  1971 to April 1979 and since no other Uganda political
                                  force was in the arena, the laurel for the removal 
                                  of Amin belongs indisputably to the UPC.
                                	The dispute or claims arise because when the Tanzania
                                  Peoples Defence Forces (TPDF) and Uganda Militia then
                                  known as Kikosi Maalum had already captured Mbarara 
                                  and Masaka, the Tanzanian Government was pressurised 
                                  by the then British Labour Government to hold a 
                                  Conference which was to agree on a Uganda Administration
                                  to succeed Amin.
                                 </p>
                                <p>I was the first to receive in the forenoon on 11 April,
                                  1979, the news of the fall of Amin. No member of Uganda
                                  National Liberation Front Administration (UNLF) could 
                                  have been the first or even amongst the first 100 people
                                  to receive the news. They could not because they were 
                                  never involved and were not in the war against Amin and
                                  were also, as their record in office showed, not a 
                                  political force. Their Party, the UNLF and their 
                                  Administration both became realities because the British
                                  labour Government pressurised Tanzania to ensure that the
                                  Uganda successor Administration to Amin was not led by 
                                  the UPC and was to be very much against the UPC.
                                	No member of the UNLF Administration and not even 
                                  Museveni who entered Uganda during the war on the 
                                  coat tails of the Tanzanian Army had participated in
                                  the raising of the Kikosi Maalum - the Uganda Militia
                                  who together with the Tanzanian Army, was fighting a 
                                  war against Amin.
                                </p>
                                <p>Throughout the UNLF Administration, the Kikosi
                                  Maalum was known as the Uganda National Liberation
                                  Army (UNLA) but another Militia which, after 
                                  January, 1986 was to be claimed to have also fought
                                  Amin under the name of FRONASA and with Museveni as
                                  its leader was not known.
                                 	Before the UNLF itself was formed, I had, as UPC 
                                  leaders, sent Teams to Masaka and Ankole Districts
                                  to mobilise the people to support the war efforts 
                                  for the overthrow of Amin. The leader of the Masaka
                                  team was Samwiri Mugwisa. The leaders of the Ankole 
                                  team were Chris Rwakasisi and Major Edward Rurangaranga.
                                  I had also sent before the formation of the UNLF a team
                                  of Economists under the leadership of Joseph Okune to 
                                  Masaka to observe, assess and report on the war damage 
                                  to the economy and infrastructure.
                                 </p>
                                <p>On 11 April, 1979 when Kampala fell to the Kikosi 
                                  Maalum and TPDF, Museveni was in Fort Portal staying
                                  with Princess Elizabeth Bagaya in the Omukama's 
                                  Palace which the TPDF who had captured the Town never
                                  damaged at all. On that same day, the President of the
                                  UNLF and all his ministers who attended the Conference
                                  at which the UNLF was formed except Museveni were, like
                                  me, in Dar es Salaam.
                                	Before dawn on 11 April when the invading armies (TPDF
                                  and Kikosi Maalum) were around King's College Budo, the
                                  Tanzanian officers who were in overall command of the 
                                  two armies asked Kikosi Maalum to enter Kampala first.
                                  The ground given was that the Ugandans in the Kikosi 
                                  Maalum knew the nooks of Kampala better than the 
                                  Tanzanian officers.
                                </p>
                                <p>When Kampala fell to the Kikosi Maalum, what the 
                                  officers of that army wanted uppermost was a telephone
                                  to ring Dar es Salaam and report the fact to their 
                                  political leader, the UPC President. Since the telephone
                                  lines to countries outside Uganda were down, the officers
                                  of the Kikosi Maalum worked hard to find someone who 
                                  could open or reactivate telephone lines to countries 
                                  outside Uganda. The officers found engineer Chris Opio 
                                  who willingly and readily went with the officers to the 
                                  telephone House in a situation where pockets of Amin's 
                                  army were firing various types of weapons randomly and 
                                  at moving vehicles.</p>
