                                  which the UPC following upon the footsteps of
                                  its parent, the Uganda National Congress (UNC),
                                  was in the forefront that the Independence of
                                  the country must mean that always and at all 
                                  times every citizen must also be free to enjoy
                                  and exercise his/her God given human rights 
                                  and freedoms without restrictions, has been
                                  replaced by dictatorship and bondage.</p>
                                <p>In June, 1989, the New Vision attributed two
                                  holocaustic reports to Museveni, the Commander
                                  of the National Resistance Army (NRA). 
                                  The first was a disclosure to diplomats that 
                                  there were, at that time in the North and 
                                  North-East, two point seven (2.7) million 
                                  people who had lost everything including homes
                                  and who were in makeshift camps without food, 
                                  water, shelter and clothing. The cause of the
                                  holocaust which made such a colossal multitude
                                  to be destitutes was not a natural disaster.</p>
                                <p>The cause of holocaust was given by Museveni 
                                  in an interview to a New Vision reporter and 
                                  published by the paper on June 27, 1989. 
                                  In the interview, Museveni disclosed the 
                                  heinous crime against humanity committed 
                                  by his army. He disclosed that there was 
                                  a policy of destroying foodstuff of millions
                                  of people in the North and North-East and 
                                  
                                  that destruction had been done and completed
                                  with the result that much of the North and the
                                  North-East had been made desolate and therefore
                                  "pacified".</p>
                                <p>Although two point seven million people were
                                  dying and suffering inhumane treatments in the
                                  makeshift camps, I did establish, through 
                                  various means, that some three million people 
                                  from the Districts of the two point seven 
                                  million were MASSACRED during the NRA military
                                  operations to destroy the foodstuff and to
                                  
                                  render the Districts desolate.</p>
                                <p>Never before have the people of Uganda been so
                                  much slaughtered and made to suffer so much 
                                  degrading treatment and deprivation as under
                                  Museveni.</p>
                                <p>Mukura is in Kumi District which is in Teso and
                                  Teso is in the North-East which Museveni told 
                                  the diplomats as having been pacified. Why was 
                                  it that some three hundred young men were 
                                  imprisoned and locked by the NRA in Railway wagons
                                  at Mukura, a pacified area, and then MASSACRED 
                                  by setting fire under the wagons! The answer can
                                  only be that the destruction of the foodstuff of
                                  millions of people, the destruction of their homes,
                                  the MASSACRES of some three million people and at 
                                  Mukura were all a deliberate policy to depopulate 
                                  Uganda so as to provide land for foreigners to farm.</p>
                                <p>The policy to depopulate Uganda and thereby to 
                                  provide land for foreigners to farm which Museveni
                                  launched in Luwero District in February 1981, is 
                                  continuing in various ways. The most telling of the
                                  ways are two namely, the impoverishment of the people
                                  of Uganda and the deliberate policy to run down 
                                  medical services so that many should die coupled 
                                  with the policy to destroy quality education so that
                                  under debilitating ignorance, the land is stolen and
                                  given to foreigners.</p>
                                <p>Dictatorship, bondage, MASSACRES, impoverishment of
                                  the people, dilapidation of hospitals and schools and
                                  the stealing of the land are being entrenched even by
                                  people who claim to be opposed to Museveni's Movement.
                                  One cannot, for instance, be opposed to the Movement 
                                  or to the dictatorship when one is a member of the 
                                  Movement's and not the People's Parliament, and such
                                  membership means giving credence and credibility to 
                                  the dictatorship on the specious ground that the voice
                                  of the opposition is in Parliament. To be seen and 
                                  recognised as being opposed to the dictatorship is not
                                  to be a member or sit in any organ of the dictatorship 
                                  such as the Parliament. To do otherwise is to deceive 
                                  the people.</p>
                                <p>Uganda's nationalist politicians and leaders of 
                                  opinions should know that the older democracies, led
                                  by London and Washington, have invested very heavily 
                                  in the Museveni dictatorship so that time may come 
                                  when the people of Uganda shall rise up and assert 
                                  the enjoyment and exercise of their God given human 
                                  rights and freedoms through carnage and much bloodshed.
                                  That time is now on the horizon.</p>
