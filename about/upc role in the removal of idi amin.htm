                                <p>There is some dispute in Uganda on what
                                  political force removed Amin's military
                                  dictatorship. The Amin coup was effected and
                                  supported by powerful countries abroad. The
                                  dictatorship which the coup ushered was
                                  therefore a political force in which countries
                                  abroad had much interest and wanted the
                                  dictatorship to last. The counter political
                                  forces in Uganda, composed of the leaders and
                                  members of the UPC and leaders and members of
                                  the DP were not organised. </p>
                                <p>When Amin appointed the DP leader and the
                                  leader accepted to be Chief Justice in a
                                  dictatorship, the DP component of the
                                  unorganised counter political force became
                                  impotent, leaving only the UPC component. Had
                                  the UPC done, nothing, there would have been
                                  no Uganda political force in the removal of
                                  Amin. This Paper, gives in summary what the
                                  UPC did from January 1971 to April 1979 and
                                  since no other Uganda political force was in
                                  the arena, the laurel for the removal of Amin
                                  belongs indisputably to the UPC. The dispute
                                  or claims arise because when the Tanzania
                                  Peoples Defence Forces (TPDF) and Uganda
                                  Militia then known as Kikosi Maalum had
                                  already captured Mbarara and Masaka, the
                                  Tanzanian Government was pressurised by the
                                  then British Labour Government to hold a
                                  Conference which was to agree on a Uganda
                                  Administration to succeed Amin. </p>
                                <p>I was the first to receive in the forenoon on
                                  11 April, 1979, the news of the fall of Amin.
                                  No member of Uganda National Liberation Front
                                  Administration (UNLF) could have been the
                                  first or even amongst the first 100 people to
                                  receive the news. They could not because they
                                  were never involved and were not in the war
                                  against Amin and were also, as their record in
                                  office showed, not a political force. Their
                                  Party, the UNLF and their Administration both
                                  became realities because the British labour
                                  Government pressurised Tanzania to ensure that
                                  the Uganda successor Administration to Amin
                                  was not led by the UPC and was to be very much
                                  against the UPC. No member of the UNLF
                                  Administration and not even Museveni who
                                  entered Uganda during the war on the coat
                                  tails of the Tanzanian Army had participated
                                  in the raising of the Kikosi Maalum - the
                                  Uganda Militia who together with the Tanzanian
                                  Army, was fighting a war against Amin. </p>
                                <p>Throughout the UNLF Administration, the
                                  Kikosi Maalum was known as the Uganda National
                                  Liberation Army (UNLA) but another Militia
                                  which, after January, 1986 was to be claimed
                                  to have also fought Amin under the name of
                                  FRONASA and with Museveni as its leader was
                                  not known. Before the UNLF itself was formed,
                                  I had, as UPC leaders, sent Teams to Masaka
                                  and Ankole Districts to mobilise the people to
                                  support the war efforts for the overthrow of
                                  Amin. The leader of the Masaka team was
                                  Samwiri Mugwisa. The leaders of the Ankole
                                  team were Chris Rwakasisi and Major Edward
                                  Rurangaranga. I had also sent before the
                                  formation of the UNLF a team of Economists
                                  under the leadership of Joseph Okune to Masaka
                                  to observe, assess and report on the war
                                  damage to the economy and infrastructure. </p>
                                <p>On 11 April, 1979 when Kampala fell to the
                                  Kikosi Maalum and TPDF, Museveni was in Fort
                                  Portal staying with Princess Elizabeth Bagaya
                                  in the Omukama's Palace which the TPDF who had
                                  captured the Town never damaged at all. On
                                  that same day, the President of the UNLF and
                                  all his ministers who attended the Conference
                                  at which the UNLF was formed except Museveni
                                  were, like me, in Dar es Salaam. Before dawn
                                  on 11 April when the invading armies (TPDF and
                                  Kikosi Maalum) were around King's College
                                  Budo, the Tanzanian officers who were in
                                  overall command of the two armies asked Kikosi
                                  Maalum to enter Kampala first. The ground
                                  given was that the Ugandans in the Kikosi
                                  Maalum knew the nooks of Kampala better than
                                  the Tanzanian officers. </p>
                                <p>When Kampala fell to the Kikosi Maalum, what
                                  the officers of that army wanted uppermost was
                                  a telephone to ring Dar es Salaam and report
                                  the fact to their political leader, the UPC
                                  President. Since the telephone lines to
                                  countries outside Uganda were down, the
                                  officers of the Kikosi Maalum worked hard to
                                  find someone who could open or reactivate
                                  telephone lines to countries outside Uganda.
                                  The officers found engineer Chris Opio who
                                  willingly and readily went with the officers
                                  to the telephone House in a situation where
                                  pockets of Amin's army were firing various
                                  types of weapons randomly and at moving
                                  vehicles.</p>
