                       I. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND


                         A. Purpose and Summary

    The bill, H.R. 1156, the ``Pandemic Unemployment Fraud 
Enforcement Act,'' as ordered reported by the Committee on Ways 
and Means on February 12, 2025, establishes a 10-year statute 
of limitations for criminal prosecution and civil enforcement 
actions related to fraudulent unemployment claims funded by 
federal pandemic unemployment programs created in the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act 
(P.L. 116-136). These programs include Pandemic Unemployment 
Assistance (PUA), Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation 
(FPUC), Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation (MEUC), and 
Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC). The bill 
doubles the statute of limitations, which expires on March 27, 
2025, from five to 10 years, allowing federal law enforcement 
to continue prosecuting criminals and recover billions in 
taxpayer dollars lost to fraud during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
There is a need for Congress to act before March 27, 2025, to 
ensure prosecution of ongoing cases; otherwise, criminal 
liability cannot be reimposed after a statute of limitations 
period has lapsed.

                 B. Background and Need for Legislation

    In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 27, 2020, 
Congress passed the CARES Act, creating several new temporary, 
federally-funded unemployment insurance (UI) programs to 
provide expanded unemployment benefits to jobless workers. The 
American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021 (P.L. 117-2) extended 
these programs through September 6, 2021. Temporary programs 
included:
           PUA: Provided benefits to unemployed gig 
        workers, freelancers, and other self-employed 
        individuals not covered by regular state UI programs.
           FPUC: Provided an additional $600/week from 
        March 2020 through July 31, 2020, for UI claimants; 
        then $300/week from January 2021 through Sept. 4, 2021.
           MEUC: Provided benefits to ``mixed-earner'' 
        unemployed workers with a combination of self-
        employment and W-2 earnings.
           PEUC: Provided an extra 13 weeks of benefits 
        after state benefits ended. State benefits typically 
        cover 26 weeks.
    In a period of less than two years, federal spending on 
unemployment benefits through these temporary programs totaled 
$675 billion.\1\ One reason for this enormous spend was the 
generous additional federal $600 per week (subsequently lowered 
to $300 per week) FPUC benefits--on top of an average state 
benefit of approximately $380 per week. This lucrative benefit 
structure, combined with weak state systems (that failed to 
have even the most basic level of identity verification) and 
federal policy that allowed self-certification for PUA 
benefits, provided an easy target for fraudsters, prisoners, 
gangs, and international criminal organizations, leading to an 
estimated $100-$135 billion in stolen unemployment benefits.\2\ 
Five years after passage of the CARES Act, the most recent data 
from the Department of Labor (DOL) shows only $5 billion of 
this theft, or roughly four percent, has been recovered.\3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    H.R. 1156 is a must-pass bill. Once the March 27, 2025, 
deadline passes, Congress cannot retroactively reimpose 
criminal liability after a limitations period has lapsed. The 
``ex post facto'' clause in the Constitution prohibits 
retroactive application of criminal laws that could punish 
someone for an act that was not considered a crime when it was 
committed. Law enforcement agencies rely on existing statutes 
under the False Claims Act (criminal statutes) and 
Administrative Claims Act (civil forfeiture), including charges 
related to mail fraud, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, 
money laundering, and conspiracy, to prosecute pandemic UI 
fraud cases. These laws generally have a five-year statute of 
limitations. Without extension, law enforcement will be unable 
to file new charges or pursue charges in cases still under 
review.
    H.R. 1156 is responsive to law enforcement agencies and is 
widely supported by state workforce agencies. The Pandemic 
Response Accountability Committee (PRAC), Department of Justice 
(DOJ), Department of Labor Inspector General (DOL-OIG), and GAO 
have all called for extending the statute of limitations to 
allow more time for prosecutions.\4\ In addition, the National 
Association of State Workforce Agencies, a non-partisan 
association of workforce agencies in all states, the District 
of Columbia, and U.S. territories has endorsed H.R. 1156.\5\ 
Congress has already acted to extend the statute of limitations 
for fraud in the COVID-era Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 
and Economic Injury and Disaster Loans (EIDL) program.\6\ In 
2022, with bi-partisan support, President Biden signed H.R. 
7334, ``COVID-19 EIDL Fraud Statute of Limitations Act of 
2022,'' and H.R. 7352, ``PPP and Bank Fraud Enforcement 
Harmonization Act of 2022,'' into law, which extended the 
statute of limitations from five to 10 years. H.R. 1156 does 
the same for CARES Act UI programs.

    COVID-19 fraud investigations involving both UI and other 
federal CARES Act programs, led by DOJ, Department of Homeland 
Security, Department of Treasury, United States Postal 
Inspection Service, DOL-OIG, and Small Business 
Administration--Office of Inspector General, have resulted in 
significant civil and criminal forfeitures and restitution 
orders. According to a DOJ memo provided to Senator James 
Lankford (R-OK) in response to a request for technical 
assistance:

        ``As of the end of 2024, forfeitures in COVID-fraud 
        linked civil administrative, civil judicial, and 
        criminal judicial forfeiture cases resulted in the 
        seizure of over $1.77 billion in assets, the final 
        forfeiture of over $1.53 billion in assets, and the 
        return of at least $642 million in forfeited assets to 
        victimized federal, state, and private entities, with 
        more victim recoveries being regularly processed. . . 
        The government also obtained significant restitution 
        orders on behalf of government and private victims. 
        Enforcement efforts as of the end of 2024 resulted in 
        the issuance of over $1.1 billion in total restitution 
        orders in matters connected to COVID-19 fraud.''\7\

    \7\Email from DOJ to Ways and Means Committee Majority staff, dated 
January 14, 2025.

    As recently as January, law enforcement agencies continue 
to prosecute cases and show recoveries. Based on information 
provided to the COVID Fraud Enforcement Task Force, U.S. 
Attorney's Offices have charged over 600 criminal UI fraud 
cases with approximate associated losses of over $300

    Some of the same professional fraudsters that committed 
fraud during the pandemic continue to target UI and other 
government programs, including emergency disaster unemployment 
assistance. During a hearing held by the Subcommittee on Work 
and Welfare on February 6, 2025, ``Time's Running Out: 
Prosecuting Fraudsters for Stealing Billions in Unemployment 
Benefits from American Workers,'' one witness stated that it 
was incredibility frustrating for him to see ``the same groups 
doing the same thing . . . they use the money for horrible 
things, child trafficking. They use it for drugs in our 
communities, they use it for terrorism . . . I'd like to tell 
you that things are better today, but just watching what's 
going on in California, seeing what happened in North Carolina, 
same groups, same playbook, stealing at scale.''\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\``Three Key Moments: Hearing on Prosecuting Fraudsters for 
Stealing Billions in Pandemic Unemployment Benefits,'' Committee on 
Ways and Means, February 10, 2025.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    During the markup of H.R. 1156, all Democrats on the 
Committee voted against the bill and rejected significant 
efforts on the part of the Majority to compromise and introduce 
a bi- partisan bill prior to the markup. Unfortunately, this is 
a theme going back to the 117th Congress, when Ways and Means 
Democrats walked away from their oversight responsibilities and 
ignored repeated calls for hearings to investigate UI fraud 
when they were in control of Congress and the White House. 
Committee Democrats gave a number of reasons for opposing H.R. 
1156, some of which were not substantively related to the bill 
itself and none of which were seriously defensible.
    Specifically, Committee Democrats criticized the rescission 
of $5 million in funding provided to DOL for fraud prevention 
and program integrity in Section 2118 of the CARES Act. 
According to DOL, approximately $30 million remains unobligated 
from the $1 billion in funding (post rescission made in the 
bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (P.L. 118-5)).\13\ 
Extending the statute of limitations is associated with some 
additional costs to states related to recordkeeping and 
administration. The CARES Act currently includes uncapped 
funding for any costs to states for administration of the 
federal CARES Act programs,\14\ including costs of 
recordkeeping and appeals necessary for prosecutions. DOL has 
the authority to fully reimburse states for these costs without 
any additional action from Congress. The Congressional Budget 
Office (CBO) estimates approximately $5 million over the next 
five years will be spent through this mechanism. To comply with 
House rules, Section 3 of the bill offsets the CBO score by 
rescinding $5 million in unobligated, prior-year appropriations 
provided by Section 2118.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\Email from DOL to Majority Staff, dated February 6, 2025.

6, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Committee Democrats argued rescinding $5 million from these 
CARES Act funds is disingenuous since those funds were provided 
to DOL to prevent fraud in the UI program and falsely claimed 
those funds were already dedicated to identity verification 
projects and would result in less funding for states. Under the 
Biden Administration, the majority of these funds were spent by 
DOL on ``equity grants'' ($260 million) and Tiger teams ($200 
million). H.R. 1156 uses $5 million of that same pot of money 
(which DOL confirmed has in fact not been obligated) for 
extending the statute of limitations on pandemic UI fraud. This 
is arguably a much more justifiable use of funds as it is 
paying for a policy that provides law enforcement agencies with 
additional time to prosecute fraud and recoup taxpayer dollars.
    Quibbling over $5 million in funding also comes across as 
short-sighted. Due to scorekeeping rules, CBO does not score 
savings associated with additional recoupment of federal funds 
as a result of extending the statute of limitations. According 
to GAO, $100-$135 billion in pandemic unemployment benefits 
were lost to fraud and DOL reports show only $5 billion has 
been recovered. If law enforcement is able to recover even one 
percent more as a result of H.R. 1156 extending the statute of 
limitations to 10 years--that would yield at the low end $1 
billion for American taxpayers. That's a 20,000-percent return 
on an investment of $5 million. Currently, DOJ has 1,648 open 
COVID-19 cases. Committee Democrats should be more concerned 
about what American taxpayers will lose if the statute of 
limitations is not extended, not to mention the number of 
criminals that will go unpunished and remain at large to 
continue their attacks to de-fraud federal programs.
    Finally, Committee Democrats, argued that extending the 
time available for prosecuting fraud would lead to ``surprise 
bills,'' harassment and the targeting of otherwise innocent 
Americans (including the elderly or a ``struggling parent'') 
who may have gotten an overpayment or received funds through 
administrative error or no fault of their own. Law enforcement 
officials are concentrating on prosecuting individuals who 
fraudulently and intentionally obtained large amounts of 
government funds, including prisoners, online scammers, 
international crime rings and gangs, not individuals who made 
honest mistakes applying for unemployment.
    An even cursory review of press releases from DOJ 
investigations shows the agencies are prosecuting complex cases 
involving criminals with malicious intent to de-fraud the 
government (see Attachment A). This includes a litany of cases 
involving international crime rings using sophisticated fraud 
schemes, many of them sourced in Nigeria and Romania. Many 
cases involved instances where funds were used to purchase 
weapons, drugs, and involved child sex trafficking.\15\ These 
cases have implications for stopping future fraud and 
associated criminal activity. In September of 2023, Maryland 
U.S. Attorney Erek Barron during an interview said that his 
office's prosecutions of COVID-19-related fraud had been 
responsible for a 20% reduction in the homicide rate in 
Baltimore.\16\

fraud prosecutions, US attorney says,'' WBALTV-11, September 15, 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Law enforcement is also prosecuting cases aimed at 
disrupting large-scale international criminal networks that 
have created national security concerns by demonstrating links 
to hostile nation states. For example, a Pennsylvania man and 
two others recently pled guilty to obtaining $59 million in 
public benefits, including unemployment, and laundering the 
proceeds to China. Cases like this are deeply concerning and 
confirm fears regarding the attacks on our institutions by 
hostile nations.\17\ These networks continue to target federal 
programs and divert funds away from those who need them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    H.R. 1156 extends the statute of limitations for cases 
exclusive to fraud with criminal intent, not innocent 
Americans. Furthermore, the CARES Act already explicitly 
provides states with broad authority to waive non-fraudulent UI 
overpayments. For example, the CARES Act allows state workforce 
agencies to waive overpayments when the overpayment is through 
``no-fault of the claimant'' and/or repayment would be 
``against equity and good conscience.'' All of these provide 
protections against the scaremongering Committee Democrats have 
engaged in to justify opposition to this bill.
    H.R. 1156 is a common-sense, straightforward bill. The 
``Pandemic Unemployment Fraud Enforcement Act,'' doubles the 
statute of limitations to allow law enforcement to fully 
prosecute criminals, secure justice for the American families 
who were harmed, and recoup the hundreds of billions in stolen 
taxpayer dollars.

                         C. Legislative History


                               BACKGROUND

    H.R. 1156 was introduced on February 10, 2025, and was 
referred to the Committee on Ways and Means.

                           COMMITTEE HEARINGS

    The Committee held the following hearing:
    On February 6, 2025, the Committee on Ways and Means 
Subcommittee on Work and Welfare held a hearing titled ``Time's 
Running Out: Prosecuting Fraudsters for Stealing Billions in 
Unemployment Benefits from American Workers.'' The purpose of 
the hearing was to investigate the need to extend the statute 
of limitations for CARES Act-related UI fraud and how 
fraudsters, international crime rings, and hostile nation 
states continue to target the UI program.

                            COMMITTEE ACTION

    The Committee on Ways and Means marked up H.R. 1156, 
``Pandemic Unemployment Fraud Enforcement Act,'' on February 
12, 2025, and ordered the bill, as amended, favorably reported 
(with a quorum being present).

                         D. Designated Hearing

    Pursuant to clause 3(c)(6) of rule XIII, the following 
hearing was used to develop and consider H.R. 1156: ``Time's 
Running Out: Prosecuting Fraudsters for Stealing Billions in 
Unemployment Benefits from American Workers,'' hearing held on 
February 6, 2025.

                      II. EXPLANATION OF THE BILL


                           REASONS FOR CHANGE

    Section 1. The Committee believes the title accurately 
reflects the content of the bill.
    Section 2. The Committee believes extending the statute of 
limitations for criminal prosecution and civil enforcement 
actions in pandemic unemployment programs from five to 10 years 
will give law enforcement officials the tools to hold 
fraudsters accountable and recover billions in taxpayer 
dollars.
    Section 3. The Committee believes the budget offset will 
provide the resources necessary to reimburse any additional 
costs states could incur for recordkeeping and administration 
as a result of extending the statute of limitations.

                       EXPLANATION OF PROVISIONS

    Section 1. This section provides the short title, Pandemic 
Unemployment Fraud Enforcement Act.
    Section 2. This section establishes a 10-year statute of 
limitations for criminal prosecution and civil enforcement 
actions related to fraudulent unemployment claims funded in 
whole or in part by the following Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and 
Economic Security (CARES) Act (P.L. 116-136) programs: Pandemic 
Unemployment Assistance; Federal Pandemic Unemployment 
Compensation and Mixed Earner Unemployment; Compensation; and 
Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation.
    Section 3. Rescinds $5,000,000 in unobligated balances from 
prior year appropriations made available to the Department of 
Labor in Section 2118 of the CARES Act.

                             EFFECTIVE DATE

    This bill would become effective upon enactment.

                     IV. BUDGET EFFECTS OF THE BILL


               A. Committee Estimate of Budgetary Effects

    In compliance with clause 3(d) of rule XIII of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives, the following statement is made 
concerning the effects on the budget of the bill, H.R. 1156, as 
reported. The estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget 
Office (CBO), which is included below.

            B. Statement Regarding New Budget Authority and
                   Tax Expenditures Budget Authority

    In compliance with clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules 
of the House of Representatives, the Committee states that the 
bill involves no new or increased budget authority. The 
Committee states further that the bill involves no new or 
increased tax expenditures.

                    C. Cost Estimate Prepared by the
                      Congressional Budget Office

    In compliance with clause 3(c)(3) of rule XIII of the Rules 
of the House of Representatives, requiring a cost estimate 
prepared by the CBO, the following statement by CBO is 
provided.




    The bill would:
           Extend the statute of limitations for 
        federal criminal fraud charges related to unemployment 
        compensation
           Rescind funding for program integrity 
        activities by state unemployment insurance agencies
    Estimated budgetary effects would mainly stem from:
           Increasing states' administrative costs that 
        would be reimbursed by the Department of Labor
           Rescinding funds for program integrity 
        activities
    Bill summary: H.R. 1156 would extend the statute of 
limitations from 5 to 10 years for federal criminal prosecution 
and civil enforcement actions for fraud related to the 
temporary unemployment programs enacted during the coronavirus 
pandemic. Under current law, the statute of limitations for 
those offenses will begin to expire in March 2025. Currently, 
states refer unemployment insurance claims involving 
allegations of fraud to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) 
at the Department of Labor (DOL) for further investigation. 
That office reviews cases and refers findings to the Department 
of Justice (DOJ) or other entities for criminal or civil 
prosecution.
    The bill also would rescind direct appropriations provided 
for program integrity activities in the American Rescue Plan 
Act of 2021.
    Estimated Federal cost: The estimated budgetary effect of 
H.R. 1156 is shown in Table 1. The costs of the legislation 
fall within budget functions 500 (education training, 
employment, and social services), 600 (income security), and 
750 (administration of justice).

CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1156 would increase revenues by less than $500,000 over the 2025-2035 period.

    Basis of estimate: CBO assumes that the bill will be 
enacted in March 2025. Estimated outlays are based on 
historical patterns for existing and similar activities.
    Direct spending and revenues: CBO estimates that enacting 
H.R. 1156 would increase net direct spending and revenues by 
less than $500,000 over the 2025-2035 period (see Table 2).

*= between zero and $500,000.

    Extend the statute of limitations: Upon the enactment of 
H.R. 1156, CBO expects that DOL would provide additional 
funding to states to continue their referrals of cases to DOL 
and provide information about those cases to the department's 
OIG and federal law enforcement agencies. Under current law, 
DOL has permanent authority to fund whatever amounts are 
necessary for those activities for pandemic-related programs. 
Using information from DOL, CBO estimates that under the bill 
the department would provide $5 million in additional funding 
to states, increasing direct spending by the same amount over 
the 2025-2035 period.
    By extending the period for which DOJ could pursue 
prosecutions, CBO expects that H.R. 1156 would increase the 
collections of penalties and the recovery of additional 
benefits paid fraudulently in 2025 and subsequent years. That 
change would not affect state laws or rules governing the 
recovery of overpayments. Based on an analysis of data for 
similar offenses from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, CBO 
estimates that the increase in penalty collections would be 
insignificant. Criminal and civil fines are recorded in the 
budget as revenues; criminal fines are deposited into the Crime 
Victims Fund and spent without further appropriation. Thus, CBO 
estimates that enacting H.R. 1156 would increase revenues and 
the associated direct spending from penalty collections by less 
than $500,000 over the 2025-2035 period. Additionally, using 
information from DOL and DOJ, CBO estimates that any additional 
recoveries of overpaid benefits, which are recorded as 
reductions in direct spending, would be insignificant. The 
extent to which any additional recoveries would happen is 
highly uncertain.
    Rescind funding for program integrity activities: The bill 
would rescind $5 million in mandatory funding provided in the 
American Rescue Plan Act to state unemployment insurance 
agencies for program integrity activities, which are undertaken 
to ensure that benefits are paid correctly. Using information 
from DOL, CBO estimates that the rescission would decrease 
direct spending by $5 million over the 2025-2035 period.
    Spending Subject to appropriation: CBO assumes that if the 
statute of limitations were extended, more potential fraud 
cases would be referred to the OIG, and that office would 
continue to investigate cases it might otherwise have dropped. 
Using information from the Department of Labor, CBO estimates 
that the OIG would require an additional $5 million over the 
2025-2030 period to handle those referrals and cases. Assuming 
appropriation of the estimated amounts, CBO estimates that 
outlays for those activities would total $5 million over the 
same period (see Table 1).
    Pay-As-You-Go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go 
Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement 
procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or 
revenues. CBO estimates that enacting the bill would increase 
direct spending by less than $500,000 over the 2025-2035 period 
and increase revenues by less than $500,000 in every year and 
over the 2025-2035 period (see Table 3).

    Increase in long-term net direct spending and deficits: CBO 
estimates that enacting H.R. 1156 would not significantly 
increase net direct spending in any of the four consecutive 10-
year periods beginning in 2036.

     V. OTHER MATTERS TO BE DISCUSSED UNDER THE RULES OF THE HOUSE


          A. Committee Oversight Findings and Recommendations

    With respect to clause 3(c)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives, the Committee made findings and 
recommendations that are reflected in this report.

        B. Statement of General Performance Goals and Objectives

    With respect to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives, the Committee advises that the 
bill does not authorize funding, so no statement of general 
performance goals and objectives is required.

              C. Information Relating to Unfunded Mandates

    This information is provided in accordance with section 423 
of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. No. 104-
4).
    The Committee has determined that the bill does not contain 
Federal mandates on the private sector. The Committee has 
determined that the bill does not impose a Federal 
intergovernmental mandate on State, local, or tribal 
governments.

  D. Congressional Earmarks, Limited Tax Benefits, and Limited Tariff 
                                Benefits

    With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed 
the provisions of the bill, and states that the provisions of 
the bill do not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax 
benefits, or limited tariff benefits within the meaning of the 
rule.

                       E. Tax Complexity Analysis

    Pursuant to clause 3(h)(1) of rule XIII of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the staff of the Joint Committee on 
Taxation has determined that a complexity analysis is not 
required under section 4022(b) of the IRS Reform Act because 
the bill contains no provisions that amend the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 and that have ``widespread applicability'' to 
individuals or small businesses, within the meaning of the 
rule.

                   F. Duplication of Federal Programs

    In compliance with clause 3(c)(5) of rule XIII of the Rules 
of the House of Representatives, the Committee states that no 
provision of the bill establishes or reauthorizes: (1) a 
program of the Federal Government known to be duplicative of 
another Federal program; (2) a program included in any report 
from the Government Accountability Office to Congress pursuant 
to section 21 of Public Law 111-139; or (3) a program related 
to a program identified in the most recent Catalog of Federal 
Domestic Assistance, published pursuant to the Federal Program 
Information Act (Pub. L. No. 95-220, as amended by Pub. L. No. 
98-169).

                assistance was without fault on the part of any 
                such individual; and

                agreement (as determined by the Secretary), 
                including any administrative expenses necessary 
                to facilitate processing of applications for 
                assistance under this section online or by

                and timely and accurate payment.
          (3) Terms of payments.--Sums payable to any State by 
        reason of such State's having an agreement under this

        in such amounts as the Secretary estimates the State 
        will be entitled to receive under this subsection for 
        each calendar month, reduced or increased, as the case 
        may be, by any amount by which the Secretary finds that 
        his estimates for any prior calendar month were greater 
        or less than the amounts which should have been paid to 
        the State. Such estimates may be made on the basis of 
        such statistical, sampling, or other method as may be 
        agreed upon by the Secretary and the State agency of 
        the State involved.

  (a) Federal-State Agreements.--Any State which desires to do 
so may enter into and participate in an agreement under this 
section with the Secretary of Labor (in this section referred 
to as the ``Secretary''). Any State which is a party to an 
agreement under this section may, upon providing 30 days' 
written notice to the Secretary, terminate such agreement.
  (b) Provisions of Agreement.--
          (1) Federal pandemic unemployment compensation.--Any 
        agreement under this section shall provide that the 
        State agency of the State will make payments of regular 
        compensation to individuals in amounts and to the 
        extent that they would be determined if the State law 
        of the State were applied, with respect to any week for 
        which the individual is (disregarding this section) 
        otherwise entitled under the State law to receive 
        regular compensation, as if such State law had been 
        modified in a manner such that the amount of regular 
        compensation (including dependents' allowances) payable 
        for any week shall be equal to--
                  (A) the amount determined under the State law 
                (before the application of this paragraph), 
                plus
                  (B) an additional amount equal to the amount 
                specified in paragraph (3) (in this section 
                referred to as ``Federal Pandemic Unemployment 
                Compensation''), plus
                  (C) an additional amount of $100 (in this 
                section referred to as ``Mixed Earner 
                Unemployment Compensation'') in any case in 
                which the individual received at least $5,000 
                of self-employment income (as defined in 
                section 1402(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
                1986) in the most recent taxable year ending 
                prior to the individual's application for 
                regular compensation.
          (2) Allowable methods of payment.--Any Federal 
        Pandemic Unemployment Compensation or Mixed Earner 
        Unemployment Compensation provided for in accordance 
        with paragraph (1) shall be payable either--
                  (A) as an amount which is paid at the same 
                time and in the same manner as any regular 
                compensation otherwise payable for the week 
                involved; or
                  (B) at the option of the State, by payments 
                which are made separately from, but on the same 
                weekly basis as, any regular compensation 
                otherwise payable.
          (3) Amount of federal pandemic unemployment 
        compensation.--

                paragraph is the following amount:
                          (i) For weeks of unemployment 
                        beginning after the date on which an 
                        agreement is entered into under this 
                        section and ending on or before July 
                        31, 2020, $600.

                        if later, the date on which such 
                        agreement is entered into), and ending 
                        on or before September 6, 2021, $300.
          (4) Certain documentation required.--An agreement 
        under this section shall include a requirement, similar 
        to the requirement under section 2102(a)(3)(A)(iii),

        respect to each applicant for Mixed Earner Unemployment 
        Compensation under paragraph (1)(C).
  (c) Nonreduction Rule.--
          (1) In general.--An agreement under this section 
        shall not apply (or shall cease to apply) with respect 
        to a State upon a determination by the Secretary that 
        the method governing the computation of regular 
        compensation under the State law of that State has been 
        modified in a manner such that the number of weeks (the 
        maximum benefit entitlement), or the average weekly 
        benefit amount, of regular compensation which will be 
        payable during the period of the agreement (determined 
        disregarding any Federal Pandemic Unemployment 
        Compensation or Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation) 
        will be less than the number of weeks, or the average 
        weekly benefit amount, of the average weekly benefit 
        amount of regular compensation which would otherwise 
        have been payable during such period under the State 
        law, as in effect on January 1, 2020.
          (2) Maximum benefit entitlement.--In paragraph (1), 
        the term ``maximum benefit entitlement'' means the 
        amount of regular unemployment compensation payable to 
        an individual with respect to the individual's benefit 
        year.
  (d) Payments to States.--
          (1) In general.--

                100 percent of--
                          (i) the total amount of Federal 
                        Pandemic Unemployment Compensation and 
                        Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation 
                        paid to individuals by the State 
                        pursuant to such agreement; and
                          (ii) any additional administrative 
                        expenses incurred by the State by 
                        reason of such agreement (as determined

                  (B) Terms of payments.--Sums payable to any 
                State by reason of such State's having an 
                agreement under this section shall be payable,

                (as determined by the Secretary), in such 
                amounts as the Secretary estimates the State 
                will be entitled to receive under this section 
                for each calendar month, reduced or increased, 
                as the case may be, by any amount by which the 
                Secretary finds that his estimates for any 
                prior calendar month were greater or less than 
                the amounts which should have been paid to the 
                State. Such estimates may be made on the basis 
                of such statistical, sampling, or other method 
                as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the 
                State agency of the State involved.
          (2) Certifications.--The Secretary shall from time to

        representation of a material fact, or knowingly has 
        failed, or caused another to fail, to disclose a 
        material fact, and as a result of such false statement 
        or representation or of such nondisclosure such 
        individual has received an amount of Federal Pandemic 
        Unemployment Compensation or Mixed Earner Unemployment 
        Compensation to which such individual was not entitled, 
        such individual--
                  (A) shall be ineligible for further Federal 
                Pandemic Unemployment Compensation or Mixed 
                Earner Unemployment Compensation in accordance

                unemployment compensation law relating to fraud 
                in connection with a claim for unemployment 
                compensation; and

        received amounts of Federal Pandemic Unemployment 
        Compensation or Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation 
        to which they were not entitled, the State shall 
        require such individuals to repay the amounts of such 
        Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation or Mixed 
        Earner Unemployment Compensation to the State agency, 
        except that the State agency may waive such repayment 
        if it determines that--
                  (A) the payment of such Federal Pandemic 
                Unemployment Compensation or Mixed Earner 
                Unemployment Compensation was without fault on 
                the part of any such individual; and
                  (B) such repayment would be contrary to 
                equity and good conscience.
          (3) Recovery by state agency.--
                  (A) In general.--The State agency shall 
                recover the amount to be repaid, or any part 
                thereof, by deductions from any Federal 
                Pandemic Unemployment Compensation or Mixed 
                Earner Unemployment Compensation payable to 
                such individual or from any unemployment 
                compensation payable to such individual under 
                any State or Federal unemployment compensation 
                law administered by the State agency or under 
                any other State or Federal law administered by 
                the State agency which provides for the payment 
                of any assistance or allowance with respect to 
                any week of unemployment, during the 3-year 
                period after the date such individuals received 
                the payment of the Federal Pandemic 
                Unemployment Compensation or Mixed Earner 
                Unemployment Compensation to which they were 
                not entitled, in accordance with the same 
                procedures as apply to the recovery of 
                overpayments of regular unemployment benefits 
                paid by the State.
                  (B) Opportunity for hearing.--No repayment 
                shall be required, and no deduction shall be

                notice thereof and an opportunity for a fair 
                hearing has been given to the individual, and 
                the determination has become final.
          (4) Review.--Any determination by a State agency 
        under this section shall be subject to review in the 
        same manner and to the same extent as determinations 
        under the State unemployment compensation law, and only 
        in that manner and to that extent.
          (5) Statute of limitations.--
                  (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other

                  (A) no payments of regular compensation can

                during such individual's base period; or
                  (B) such individual's rights to such

                an agreement under this section shall apply 
                with respect to a State only upon a

                State law or other applicable rules of such 
                State, the payment of extended compensation for 
                which an individual is otherwise eligible must

                entitlement), or the average weekly benefit 
                amount, of regular compensation which will be 
                payable during the period of the agreement will

                        been used to establish a benefit year 
                        but for the application of this

                        to pandemic emergency unemployment 
                        compensation without regard to any 
                        rights to regular compensation if the 
                        individual elects to not file a claim 
                        for regular compensation under the new 
                        benefit year.

Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation.--
          (1) In general.--There shall be paid to each State

        an amount equal to 100 percent of the pandemic 
        emergency unemployment compensation paid to individuals 
        by the State pursuant to such agreement.
          (2) Treatment of reimbursable compensation.--No 
        payment shall be made to any State under this section 
        in respect of any compensation to the extent the State 
        is entitled to reimbursement in respect of such 
        compensation under the provisions of any Federal law 
        other than this section or chapter 85 of title 5, 
        United States Code. A State shall not be entitled to 
        any reimbursement under such chapter 85 in respect of

        reimbursement under this section in respect of such 
        compensation.
          (3) Determination of amount.--Sums payable to any 
        State by reason of such State having an agreement under 
        this section shall be payable, either in advance or by

        Secretary), in such amounts as the Secretary estimates 
        the State will be entitled to receive under this 
        section for each calendar month, reduced or increased, 
        as the case may be, by any amount by which the 
        Secretary finds that the Secretary's estimates for any 
        prior calendar month were greater or less than the 
        amounts which should have been paid to the State. Such 
        estimates may be made on the basis of such statistical, 
        sampling, or other method as may be agreed upon by the 
        Secretary and the State agency of the State involved.

                Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1105(a)) of the 
                Unemployment Trust Fund (as established by 
                section 904(a) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1104(a)) 
                shall be used for the making of payments to

                this section.
                  (B) Transfer of funds.--Notwithstanding any 
                other provision of law, the Secretary of the

                of the Treasury (from funds not otherwise 
                appropriated) to the extended unemployment 
                compensation account such sums as the Secretary 
                of Labor estimates to be necessary to make 
                payments described in subparagraph (A). There 
                are appropriated from the general fund of the 
                Treasury, without fiscal year limitation, the 
                sums referred to in the preceding sentence and 
                such sums shall not be required to be repaid.
          (2) Administration.--
                  (A) In general.--There are appropriated out 
                of the employment security administration 
                account (as established by section 901(a) of 
                the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1101(a)) of 
                the Unemployment Trust Fund, without fiscal 
                year limitation, such funds as may be necessary 
                for purposes of assisting States (as provided 
                in title III of the Social Security Act (42 
                U.S.C. 501 et seq.)) in meeting the costs of 
                administration of agreements under this 
                section.
                  (B) Transfer of funds.--Notwithstanding any 
                other provision of law, the Secretary of the 
                Treasury shall transfer from the general fund 
                of the Treasury (from funds not otherwise 
                appropriated) to the employment security 
                administration account such sums as the 
                Secretary of Labor estimates to be necessary to 
                make payments described in subparagraph (A). 
                There are appropriated from the general fund of 
                the Treasury, without fiscal year limitation, 
                the sums referred to in the preceding sentence 
                and such sums shall not be required to be 
                repaid.
          (3) Certification.--The Secretary shall from time to 
        time certify to the Secretary of the Treasury for 
        payment to each State the sums payable to such State 
        under this subsection. The Secretary of the Treasury, 
        prior to audit or settlement by the Government 
        Accountability Office, shall make payments to the State 
        in accordance with such certification, by transfers 
        from the extended unemployment compensation account (as 
        so established) to the account of such State in the 
        Unemployment Trust Fund (as so established).
  (e) Fraud and Overpayments.--
          (1) In general.--If an individual knowingly has made, 
        or caused to be made by another, a false statement or 
        representation of a material fact, or knowingly has 
        failed, or caused another to fail, to disclose a 
        material fact, and as a result of such false statement 
        or representation or of such nondisclosure such 
        individual has received an amount of pandemic emergency 
        unemployment compensation under this section to which 
        such individual was not entitled, such individual--
                  (A) shall be ineligible for further pandemic 
                emergency unemployment compensation under this 
                section in accordance with the provisions of 
                the applicable State unemployment compensation 
                law relating to fraud in connection with a 
                claim for unemployment compensation; and
                  (B) shall be subject to prosecution under 
                section 1001 of title 18, United States Code.
          (2) Repayment.--In the case of individuals who have 
        received amounts of pandemic emergency unemployment 
        compensation under this section to which they were not 
        entitled, the State shall require such individuals to 
        repay the amounts of such pandemic emergency 
        unemployment compensation to the State agency, except 
        that the State agency may waive such repayment if it 
        determines that--
                  (A) the payment of such pandemic emergency 
                unemployment compensation was without fault on 
                the part of any such individual; and
                  (B) such repayment would be contrary to 
                equity and good conscience.
          (3) Recovery by state agency.--
                  (A) In general.--The State agency shall 
                recover the amount to be repaid, or any part 
                thereof, by deductions from any pandemic 
                emergency unemployment compensation payable to 
                such individual under this section or from any 
                unemployment compensation payable to such 
                individual under any State or Federal 
                unemployment compensation law administered by 
                the State agency or under any other State or 
                Federal law administered by the State agency 
                which provides for the payment of any 
                assistance or allowance with respect to any 
                week of unemployment, during the 3-year period 
                after the date such individuals received the 
                payment of the pandemic emergency unemployment 
                compensation to which they were not entitled, 
                in accordance with the same procedures as apply 
                to the recovery of overpayments of regular 
                unemployment benefits paid by the State.
                  (B) Opportunity for hearing.--No repayment 
                shall be required, and no deduction shall be 
                made, until a determination has been made, 
                notice thereof and an opportunity for a fair 
                hearing has been given to the individual, and 
                the determination has become final.
          (4) Review.--Any determination by a State agency 
        under this section shall be subject to review in the 
        same manner and to the same extent as determinations

                         VII. DISSENTING VIEWS

    Ways and Means Democrats strongly support bringing to 
justice the criminals who stole from our unemployment system 
during the pandemic. We have consistently supported Department 
of Labor Inspector General Larry Turner as he and his team 
secured 1,400 convictions and over a billion dollars in court-
ordered restitution.
    Two years ago, we offered to work with our Republican 
colleagues to extend the statute of limitations at IG Turner's 
request. They instead chose to rush to the House floor with 
legislation that experts said would not correctly extend the 
statute of limitations but did cut $2 billion from the 
Department of Labor's fraud-fighting budget and pressure states 
to investigate and prosecute innocent workers. At that markup, 
Ways and Means Republicans rejected amendments to protect 
Social Security recipients, farmers, and parents from this 
senseless harassment.
    We also opposed Republican cuts to the Office of the 
Inspector General (OIG) budget that forced it to lay off staff 
and slow its work, which increased the number of cases at risk 
of not being completed before they reached the statute of 
limitations.
    Less than two weeks before H.R. 1156 was introduced and 
considered in Committee, President Trump fired IG Turner, along 
with 16 other Senate-confirmed agency Inspectors General. 
Inspectors General are primary prosecutors of fraud and 
instruments of agency accountability to the American people. 
Just before our markup, the President fired yet another agency 
watchdog for daring to criticize Administration actions. The 
silence from our colleagues about the firing of IG Turner, a 
respected public official that House Republicans were publicly 
praising just a few weeks before his firing, has been 
deafening.
    This bill would give the OIG five additional years to file 
charges for alleged fraud in the pandemic UI programs, whether 
the charges are against a criminal mastermind who used stolen 
Social Security numbers to steal millions of dollars or a 
struggling parent who was accidentally overpaid by an 
overworked state UI system. IG Turner had laid out and was 
following a clear plan to go after real fraud and criminal 
rings, not innocent people. His firing, and that of 17 other 
Senate-confirmed watchdogs, coupled with the flood of career 
prosecutors quitting rather than obeying illegal orders by the 
Trump Administration, makes us unsure how the authority would 
be used.
    In addition to the risk of illegal prosecution and 
harassment, this bill would cut a small but important source of 
anti-fraud funding at the Department of Labor. Although the 
funding is technically ``unobligated,'' the Department has been 
using it to cover costs associated with providing free identity 
verification tools to states and also providing other technical 
assistance to states to prevent fraud and ensure timely access 
to benefits. Cutting that funding might mean it would run out, 
increasing fraud in the future.
    At our markup, Reps. Chu and DelBene tried to offer an 
amendment to extend the statute of limitations for six months 
and then provide the extension to 10 years once the President 
reinstated IG Turner or followed the law to replace him with a 
Senate-confirmed successor who could be trusted to use 
additional prosecution power fairly. Republicans refused to 
allow the amendment to be considered.
    We regret that we are unable to support H.R. 1156. However, 
we are open to Republicans who decide to join us in fighting 
fraud and protecting American workers.
                                           Richard E. Neal,
                                                    Ranking Member.

                            DISSENTING VIEWS

    We held a markup last Congress where this committee looked 
at unemployment insurance fraud. I offered an amendment then 
which would have extended that statute of limitations for those 
who committed unemployment insurance fraud during the pandemic.
    Larry Turner, the respected Inspector General of the 
Department of Labor, who was wrongfully terminated by this 
administration, made a compelling case to us that it would take 
his investigators and prosecutors time to investigate and build 
strong legal cases for some of the worst fraud of the 
pandemic--sophisticated criminal rings that used stolen 
identity and bank account information to steal millions, or 
even billions of taxpayer dollars.
    IG Turner and his team also delivered on their promises. 
They focused on bringing the worst criminals to justice, and 
have secured 1,400 convictions and over a billion dollars in 
court-ordered restitution. I'd like to enter the COVID-19 Fraud 
Enforcement Task Force report into the record. I later withdrew 
that amendment upon agreement with Chairman Smith that we would 
work together to address this issue.
    Throughout the last two years, Republicans and Democrats 
came to an agreement: extend the statute of limitations, that's 
it. It even made it into the Unemployment Insurance Integrity 
and Accessibility Act, a bipartisan bill negotiated by Crapo-
Wyden.
    However, while this bill extends the statute of 
limitations, it rescinds critical funding we provided in the 
American Rescue Plan that the Department of Labor has been 
using on an ongoing basis to fund, among other things, free 
state access to two critical identify verification tools--
login.gov and in-person identity verification at the Post 
Office. These tools are used by the Department of Labor and 
states to confirm identity and prevent fraud. So, while we are 
extending the time period for which law enforcement can 
prosecute those who committed fraud, we are taking away funding 
to prevent future fraud.
    I am disappointed that yet another bipartisan agreement has 
been walked back by my Republican colleagues.
    I cannot support legislation that solves one problem but 
creates another. I urge my colleague to vote no unless changed.

                                                     Mike Thompson.
